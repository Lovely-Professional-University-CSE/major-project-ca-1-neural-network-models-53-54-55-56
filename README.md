# We are working on Iris DataSet.
# Dataset has 5 attributes.(Sepal width ,Sepal length, petal length, petal width, and target)

We need to classify the species of the flower 
We gave 3 types of species setosa, vesricolor, virginica.

# We are working on the Different Models such as perceptron, Som, Lvq, Svm

1. Preceptron:-A perceptron is a simple model of a biological neuron in an artificial neural network. The perceptron algorithm was designed to classify visual inputs, categorizing subjects into one of two types and separating groups with a line. Classification is an important part of machine learning and image processing.

2. SOM:-A self-organizing map (SOM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map, and is therefore a method to do dimensionality reduction

3. LVQ:-The Learning Vector Quantization algorithm (or LVQ for short) is an artificial neural network algorithm that lets you choose how many training instances to hang onto and learns exactly what those instances should look like.

4. SVM:-In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.
